All services involved in solution are deployed through Amazon CloudFormation, with deterministic deployment with Infrastructure As Code. Whole data flows are as shown below: Solution Features\uff1a Streaming: Provides streaming addresses and access to a large number of devices, supports mainstream RTMP protocol; supports common third-party streaming software such as OBS, supports common third-party RTMP streaming hardware (encoders or boxes); Video playback: support HTTP-FLV (2 seconds delay) and HLS/CMAF (more than 10 seconds delay) three playback protocols; support common third-party FLV, RTMP, HLS players VLC, FFPLAY; Video processing functions: video transcoding, video recording, video screenshots, live watermarking, live relaying, etc.; Video frequency storage and on-demand: video storage (cold/hot layering is available), support recording hls fragments on-demand; Management console: Provide API management and graphical management; Address management: unified streaming domain name and streaming domain name management; Security: supports push stream URL authentication, using CloudFront signed URL for playback authentication, supports playback URL anti-theft chaining and playback authentication; Solution Applicable Senario\uff1a Ordinary/low-latency live streaming: to meet the ordinary and low-latency live streaming needs of small and medium-sized customers, such as live streaming in games, e-commerce, media, education and other industries; Large-concurrent uplink video cloud storage: to connect monitoring equipment and smart devices through standardized protocols, and perform recording, storage and video processing for video streaming in cloud; Solution Characteristic\uff1a Serverlsss, end-to-end: Based on Amazon cloud-native architecture, no capacity planning is required, and operation and maintenance effort is reduce to great extent; Simple, open source, easy integrated: to meet the needs of non-professional customers for live video streaming, transfer, and pull to play, all service are open sourced and seamless integrated with Amazon hosting services; Large capacity supporting multiple channels: Based on ECS elastic architecture, resource can be auto-scaled according to workloads of push-pull streams, thus supporting massive video stream channel in parallel; Console management: You can manage video stream metadata through graphical console and API, and you can also set up live streaming functions suitable for your business scenarios according to your needs, such as recording, transcoding, screenshots, watermarks, etc. One-click deployment: One-click deployment of the solution through CloudFormation (Beijing, Ningxia region) Overall Architecture\uff1a Key Modules Video Proxy High-availability proxy server cluster built on ECS Service, providing RTMP streaming addresses and massive devices accessing, adopts lightweight HAPoxy, supports RTMP and provides unified streaming addresses: RTMP://<DNS Name>/stream/<stream key> Video Gateway High-performance and lightweight RTMP server based on Node media server, support RTMP/RTMPs stream access, maintain metadata including streaming status, channel session etc., maintain push stream client status based on event callbacks, to monitor client's online status, and schedule ECS tasks accordingly Meta Data Management Use DynamoDB to manage metadata of video stream, and provide Restful API of CRUD management of metadata through the API gateway; Dynamically configure video stream processing parameters; Auto generate a unique video push channel; Fetch video push & pull URLs through the API Video Processing Video live streaming, transcoding, recording, fragmentation and other functions based on Fargate, including: High performance ngnix http server Video real time encoding & transcoding Video & image fragmentation and S3 storagem, customized fragmentation time and transcoding parameters Suppoer HTTP-FLV (2s delay) and HLS/CMAF (10s delay) Adjust parameter dynamically, seamless integrate with Amazon services Video Distribution Channel addressing and video acceleration based on Fargate and CloudFront, including: Video distribution cluster management, video stream pulling path\uff1aRoute53-> CloudFront-> ALB-> video distribution service-> video processing service Realize multiple input streams to one output through automatic addressing Built-in Nginx cache to reduce the load on the server as much as possible to avoid thundering herd problem Using CloudFront to optimize the downstream experience and secure video access through signed URL Demo Web page Note that this web page is for demonstration purposes only, solution WILL NOT create such web page by default unless explicit configured in CloudFormation parameter Function of demo web page include: Domain configuration Live streaming managment Video recording Watermark configuration Video Relay VoD Installation & Deployment\uff1a Prerequisite Make sure you have a domain name registered by ICP\uff0cclick here to understand how to file for ICP Click Here to jump Amazon CloudFormation console (Beijing), click Next to deploy Click Next to configure the deployment options. InstallDemoConsole configures whether to deploy the user demo web interface, default value is false. CNAME configures the CNAMEs associated with CloudFront. ZHY/BJS region users need to use the registered domain name for association otherwise you may not access your distribution normally. Overseas users do not have such requirement, default value is www.example.cn. You need to choose at least two availability zones to create new VPC network for network configuration. Also note the maximum length of stack name is 128 characters, we recommend to use shorter stack name such as: LiveStream. [ optional ]After the solution is deployed, if you want to distribute video streams via HTTPS to further enhance security, you can follow the steps below to additionally configure your CloudFront and Elastic Load Balancer services Step1, obtain the SSL certificate corresponding to your domain name install certbot\uff0cexecute command below (for mac user) brew install certbot sudo certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns -d \"*.<your domain prefix>.aws.a2z.org.cn\" After execution, the console prompts similar information as follows: Please deploy a DNS TXT record under the name _acme-challenge.<your domain prefix>.aws.a2z.org.cn with the following value: 8ZCAA6XvwLKK3MiGLRufX1p0_gIHnT-xxxx following instruction \u201c_acme-challenge. .aws.a2z.org.cn Route 53 TXT type entry and set the value to 8ZCAA6XvwLKK3MiGLRufX1p0_gIHnT-xxxx\u201d to add the corresponding string to the domain name record you manage, and then click confirm.
